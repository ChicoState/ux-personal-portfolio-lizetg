# PlayStation 4 Confusion
I was given my little brother's PlayStation 4 when he upgraded and got a new one. I use it to watch netflix or other streaming services or play some games. The PlayStation 4 is very similar to the PlayStation 3 as I have used that often. 

The dash boards, or place you can choose what app to use or where to go, both have similar layouts and I thought they would be used pretty much the same. Here is a side by side of them.

They both had an option to use your account and play games online. This option was not required in the PlayStation 3. I was used to being able to use the PlayStation 3 anytime with no issues. For the PlayStation 4, I have never been able to use it right. If I try to watch netflix, I am brought to a screen that tells me I need to sign in and have me select from the various profiles on the console. The screen it brings me to is below. The issue is, I am already signed in. I made myself a new account. I would sign into my account again. I do not use consoles often, so I would just assume it worked the the previous console Sony made. My mental model, or idea on how this product would work, was incorrect.

I panicked and called my brother trying to get an answer of why this will not work and he advised me to sign in and make sure the wifi was connected. I expressed how I was already signed in and connected to wifi and no matter what we did, it would not let me watch anything or play any games without making an online account that is separate from the account I already made. It is very inconvenient to have to make multiple accounts. I resorted to just sharing an account with him. It would be easier if it was made just like the last console because not everyone is a big gamer and understands you need an online account to play games and make friends to stream services. I was really frustrated because I felt like I did all the simple basic steps properly. I think it would be easier if the pop up screen mentioned which account specifically to sign into so I was not going in circles.
